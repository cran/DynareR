Description: It allows running 'Dynare' program from base R and R Markdown. 'Dynare' is a software platform for handling a wide class of economic models, in particular dynamic stochastic general equilibrium ('DSGE') and overlapping generations ('OLG') models.  This package does not only integrate R and Dynare but also serves as a 'Dynare' Knit-Engine for 'knitr' package. The package requires 'Dynare' (<https://www.dynare.org/>) and 'Octave' (<https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download.html>).  Write all your 'Dynare' commands in R or R Markdown chunk.
